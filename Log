  -The View Member Page has been edited by addition of search bar and data display table.
  -The Package previously known as gymjankari_v1.HomePage has been renamed to gymjankari_v1.MainView and the files HomePage.fxml and HomePageController.java has been deleted.
  -A new library controlfx has been added to the project in order to enhance the UI controls. So far this library has been used to control the notification pushing mechanism.
  -The package for dialogbox has been removed as notification system is used in place of them.
  -Notification is popped up at top right corner of screen when member is added.
To Amit Shrestha @amit-shrestha
   -Please add the JAR file for controlfx library if not added automatically when you pull this version.The file has been uploaded in usual place as other library.
   -To know the code used for notification refer to the AddMemberPageController.java file where you used the classic system.out.println code which has been replaced.
